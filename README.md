# ScalaModTemplate

A Scala Mindustry mod template.

## Building

1. Install JDK (I use openjdk-11)
2. Run `gradlew clean build` (Windows) or `./gradlew clean build` (Linux)
3. The jarfile will be in the `build/libs` folder 

## The mod

Mod uses java to glue scala library with mindustry API, which means you can add some java code alongside scala code.

It does not add any new content and serves a demo purpose.

Some features might be broken so there is no guarantee it will work perfectly.
